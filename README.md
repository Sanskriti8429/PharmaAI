# Pharma AI Discovery Platform

An advanced pharmaceutical research platform powered by agentic AI for drug discovery, repurposing opportunities, and market intelligence.

## Features

### Master Agent Orchestration
- Intelligent query parsing and task decomposition
- Coordinated multi-agent workflow execution
- Real-time status updates and progress tracking
- Comprehensive result synthesis

### Specialized Worker Agents

1. **IQVIA Insights Agent** - Market analysis, sales trends, and competitive intelligence
2. **Clinical Trials Agent** - Pipeline data from ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP
3. **Patent Landscape Agent** - Patent searches, expiry timelines, and FTO analysis
4. **EXIM Trends Agent** - Export-import data for APIs and formulations
5. **Web Intelligence Agent** - Real-time search for guidelines and publications
6. **Internal Knowledge Agent** - Internal document and strategy analysis
7. **Report Generator Agent** - Polished report generation with charts and tables

### Key Capabilities

- **Interactive Chat Interface** - Natural language queries with the Master Agent
- **Real-time Processing** - Live updates as agents process your request
- **Comprehensive Analysis** - Multi-source data aggregation and synthesis
- **Report Generation** - Downloadable research reports with detailed findings
- **Query History** - Review and search past research queries
- **Data Source Management** - Monitor connections to pharmaceutical databases
- **System Health Monitoring** - Real-time agent status and performance metrics

## Example Queries

- "Find respiratory molecules with low competition but high patient burden in emerging markets"
- "Analyze Metformin's potential for repurposing in oncology indications"
- "Which anti-diabetic drugs have patents expiring in the next 2 years?"
- "Show clinical trial landscape for GLP-1 receptor agonists"
- "Identify opportunities in rare disease repurposing for cardiovascular drugs"

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **State Management**: React Context API

## Usage

The platform simulates a complete agentic AI system with:
- Mock data sources for demonstration
- Simulated agent processing with realistic delays
- Dynamic response generation based on query content
- Professional report generation capabilities

All agent responses are intelligently generated based on query keywords and pharmaceutical research patterns.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Built with modern pharmaceutical research workflows in mind.
